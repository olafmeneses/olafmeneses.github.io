    "text": "This was a triumph!\nI’m making a blog here.\n\n\n\nWhat is this blog for?\nThis is a personal blog. Personal means I have the freedom to write about anything that interests me and, more importantly, to do so when I like. Don’t expect regular updates – this won’t be a daily, weekly, or even monthly affair. This is not a newsletter. I imagine this as a shelf of personal experiences. After I finish something I’ve worked on and consider meaningful, I place it on the shelf. A public library of my personal experiences (related to data science).\nYou can also consider it as an observer’s notebook. I believe I’m a very observant person. I tend to notice details that escape the attention of the vast majority. Here, you will find the thought process of some projects I’ve worked on, small projects, ideas, thoughts… or anything that catches my attention.\nHaving explained that, the question that naturally arises is…\n\n\nWho am I talking to?\nSince I make this blog public on the Internet, it’s obvious that anyone can read it. But that doesn’t mean my target audience is anyone. Why would anyone care about some data science projects?\nI don’t really know how you got here. Maybe you’re working on a task that is similar to something I’ve done. You may end up saving some time, you may come up with a different solution than the one you had in mind… or maybe you just want to learn about the projects I’ve worked on. Either way, I hope you find great value in the mistakes and successes I’ve had so far. I believe there’s always something to learn or discover.\nI’m also talking to my future self. As I said before, I want to think about this blog as a notebook or repository of my observations during my journey as a data scientist. But I could do this without making it public, so let’s ignore this case.\n\n\nThe End of the Beginning\nThe other sections begin with a question. This one doesn’t.\nLife constantly asks you questions (many people believe that they are the ones asking the questions, although it’s the opposite). When life comes to an end, it stops asking, since you cannot answer. When life comes to an end, you must quote something and remain silent, leaving the echo alive:\n\nThink of all the things we learned for the people who are still alive."

    "section": "The Big Q",
    "text": "The Big Q\nWith numbers 1-10, just 10 words, can we classify languages into known language families?\nWe will proceed as follows:\n\nIdentify different distance functions to compute with our data (dataset of +3000 languages)\nFor each distance, calculate the distance matrix\nBased on k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classification (since we know the correct groups), determine which distance method works better and compute its distance matrix\nPerform Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and tSNE to visualize the data\nGenerate an interactive visualization of the k-NN graph\nConstruct a dendrogram to reveal hierarchical language relationships (only with the Indo-European language family)\n\nNote: k-NN classification relies on known language family groupings. Only languages with identified families are retained, excluding Almean, Constructed languages, and Pidgins and Creoles families due to their artificial or pidgin/creole nature. Moreover, the languages named written or numerals will be excluded because they represent the written form of their respective languages.\n\nWhich distance is better?\nMy idea (initially) was to compare languages by looking at the positions of their numbers sorted alphabetically. I didn’t have any hope that it would be great. It wasn’t great. At all. This distance is somewhat random and doesn’t retain relevant information. However, I think that stupid ideas sometimes (and only sometimes) lead you to interesting places.\nAfter the initial failure, I tried with a well-known distance for strings: Levenshtein distance.\nThe Levenshtein distance counts the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) needed to change one string into the other. So, the smaller the Levenshtein distance between two strings, the more similar they are.\nWe will now see an example of why we should make some modifications to define a new distance. If you have the strings “hello” and “hello”, the Levenshtein distance is 0. That makes sense. But here’s the problem:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nString 1\nString 2\nLevenshtein Distance\n\n\n\n\nhello\nhellozzzzz\n5\n\n\nhello\nazxyp\n5\n\n\n\nAlthough both have the same Levenshtein distance of 5, would you say that both strings are at the same distance (equally similar/dissimilar)? We can address this by normalizing the distance.\nTo do this, we divide the distance calculated by the maximum length of the strings s1 and s2 being compared (\\(max(length(\\text{s1}),\\,length(\\text{s1}))\\), where length is the number of characters of each string). The minimum distance is 0, while the maximum distance is set at 1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nString 1\nString 2\nNormalized Levenshtein Distance\n\n\n\n\nhello\nhellozzzzz\n0.5\n\n\nhello\nazxyp\n1\n\n\n\nThis way, we can compare distances between strings of different lengths more fairly.\nWe will compare different distance functions (the one based on alphabetically ordering, DL [Damerau-Levenshtein], Levenshtein and OSA [Optimal String Alignment]). These last three are string distance functions and variations of Levenshtein’s idea. We will also compare the unmodified and normalized versions.\nAs we already said, we will calculate the accuracy with the k-NN. First, we will see for which value of k we get the higher mean accuracy. As we can see in the table below, the best option is k=1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this value of k, we already see which are the distances with higher accuracy with the next plot. The normalized versions are slightly better than the unmodified ones. The accuracy with the distance based on the alphabetic sorting is awful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we show which is the mean accuracy for each distance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest distance\nThe distance we will use from now on is the normalized version of Damerau-Levenshtein. The accuracy score for the different families/subfamilies levels can be found in the next table. We have to take into account that with this method we cannot classify correctly some languages because we only have one sample from that family language (for example, Basque, a language isolate). Because of this, correct classification can be achieved for only 169 out of the 178 languages in this set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDimensionality reduction\nIn order to visualize the different clusters corresponding to the language families, we will use two dimensionality reduction techniques: MDS and tSNE. We will not use the set of +3000 languages, but a smaller one of (178) languages which have +1 million speakers.\nI will not explain how MDS or tSNE (Maaten and Hinton 2008) work (for that, I recommend this and this), since it’s not the main goal of this post.\n\nMDS\nUsing MDS, it appears feasible to distinguish families with a larger number of languages, such as Indo-European and Niger-Congo, while the remaining languages are clustered together. It’s important to note that in MDS, the x, y, and z axes lack an interpretable meaning.\nNote: You can click on any image to make it bigger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a 3D plot that you can interact with. You can observe that adding a third dimension helps to separate some clusters like Sino-Tibetan or Tai (yellow/orange colors). Still, there are many points clustered in the center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntSNE\nWith tSNE, it seems that we can capture both the local and global structure of the data. The different language families are more apart from each other and, moreover, language families that are somewhat related (Tai and Sino-Tibetan) are close to each other. As in MDS, the x, y, and z axes do not have an interpretable meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 3D plot, it becomes easier to assess how well tSNE performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nk-Nearest Neighbors graph\nIf you prefer a simpler interface, you can explore a k-NN graph here. You have selectors to highlight family groups or languages and zoom in to observe closely related languages. We are using the same layout of points from tSNE but we have added some jitter to the points to prevent overlap with the language name labels.\nI highly recommend interacting with it: click on any language, and it will highlight its neighbors. As in previous examples, we use k=1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHierarchical clustering\nWe carried out a hierarchical cluster analysis using the McQuitty agglomeration (linkage) method to explore the linguistic relationships within the Indo-European language family. The decision to focus on Indo-European languages was intentional for two reasons. Firstly, the Indo-European language family stands out as one of the most thoroughly researched and widely recognized language families in linguistics; therefore, we have greater certainty about the established subfamilies. Secondly, by selecting a reduced subset, we simplify the visualization.\nNote: Every dendrogram will be preceded by a legend, providing clarity on the color scheme used to represent different language subfamilies.\nFor this first dendrogram, we color-coded each language based on its first subfamily. By visualizing the dendrogram in this manner, we gain insights into the higher-level relationships among language subfamilies, such as Germanic, Romance, Slavic, and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this second dendrogram, we opted to color-code each language according to its deepest subfamily possible within the Indo-European family tree. For instance, if two languages belong to the same subfamily but diverge at deeper levels, they will be represented with distinct colors in the dendrogram. This approach tries to visualize with finer detail how Indo-European languages are connected and how they’ve evolved. Although the dendrogram is not perfect, I would say it is quite good and approximates the established subfamilies."

Nonetheless, you don’t need to read it to understand this one. They’re somewhat independent.\nGiven the title and description of the post, you can imagine what we will see today. The idea is to try some classification, clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques to see what these 10 words can tell us about different language families.\nAs I mentioned in the previous post, I’ve also created a Shiny app where you can visualize +3800 languages in an interactive 3D plot. I think it’s pretty cool. I highly recommend checking it out: [Ref: shiny app]!\nBefore we start getting into the matter, let’s take a look at the data. For each language, we have the following information:\nFor example, in the case of English, we would have:\nWe can have a look at all the languages in the following table, where we show the language, its family and the names of its numbers."

    "text": "Which distance is better?\nMy idea (initially and because of [Ref: prev_post]) was to compare languages by looking at the positions of their numbers sorted alphabetically. I didn’t have any hope that it would be great. It wasn’t great. At all. This distance is somewhat random and doesn’t retain relevant information. However, I think that stupid ideas sometimes (and only sometimes) lead you to interesting places.\nAfter the initial failure, I tried with a well-known distance for strings: Levenshtein distance.\nThe Levenshtein distance counts the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) needed to change one string into the other. So, the smaller the Levenshtein distance between two strings, the more similar they are.\nWe will now see an example of why we should make some modifications to define a new distance. If you have the strings “hello” and “hello”, the Levenshtein distance is 0. That makes sense. But here’s the problem:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nString 1\nString 2\nLevenshtein Distance\n\n\n\n\nhello\nhellozzzzz\n5\n\n\nhello\nazxyp\n5\n\n\n\nAlthough both have the same Levenshtein distance of 5, would you say that both strings are at the same distance (equally similar/dissimilar)?

I thought I would get an accuracy for the first-level family of 0.6-0.8. Instead, what we got here is that we correctly classified 154 out of 178 languages (86.5168539325843%).\nI had some intuition on why it worked so well. But I wanted to explore if anyone had already investigated it. I found (Calude 2021), which explains:\n\nLexical replacement rates vary enormously among words and among languages. In words that linguists believe to be the least rapidly changing within a given language, namely words that designate basic vocabulary terms, like foot, green, man, dirty, husband, wife, mother, and including numbers one through to five—a collection of words termed the Swadesh List (named after Morris Swadesh, who formulated various such lists)—rates of lexical replacement can still vary between word-forms as much as 100-fold [7, p. 8]. But number words stand out as being among the most conservatively preserved word-forms even in such basic vocabulary lists [7]. Remarkably, in the Indo-European language family, a single cognate set can be traced throughout its entire history, indicating astonishing agreement across speakers and time [7]. Put another way, speakers of Indo-European languages have preserved ancestral forms for low-limit numbers with extreme fidelity over thousands of years of language change."

Let’s take a look at Langue nouvelle:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLangue nouvelle (French for ‘new language’) is a grammatical sketch for a proposed artificial international auxiliary language presented in 1765 by Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve, a French economist, in the ninth volume of Diderot’s encyclopedia. […] Each numeral starts with a different consonant, and are in alphabet order.\n(“Langue Nouvelle - Wikipedia”)\n\nThis is interesting. Considering that the alphabet itself is a product of human invention, it becomes improbable for the initial N numbers of any language (which use an alphabet) to be arranged alphabetically by chance. Out of +3800 languages only 8 have their first 10 numbers sorted in alphabetical order perfectly. From those 8, 75% of them are constructed languages.\nTherefore, we can conclude that this feature arises from deliberate design rather than occurring by chance or natural evolution. I was hoping that more (non-artificial) languages would have this feature, but it’s rarer than I thought."

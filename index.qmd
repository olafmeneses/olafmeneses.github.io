# Hello!

I'm Olaf, currently a third-year Data Science student at the University of Valencia. I have a strong foundation in key data science disciplines, a proven track record of academic excellence, and a passion for data-driven insights and innovation.

### Academic Excellence
Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently demonstrated my dedication to excellence. Only in the last two years, I have earned a total of 20 distinctions with Honors in various subjects, including: Statistical Inference, Databases, Data Processing, Data Visualization...

### Awards and Recognition

- First prize in the II Valencia SDG Data Visualization Contest (Sep. 2022), with the project [_Ruzafapp_](https://olafmeneses.shinyapps.io/ruzafapp).

- Second prize in the Valencia SDG Data Visualization Contest (Sep. 2023), with the project [_VLC Tr√†nsitAire_](https://olafmeneses.shinyapps.io/transitaire), where I collaborated with a team of five members.

- Top 1% of University Entrance Exam (PAU) scores at the University of Valencia, out of nearly 7000 students.

### Not everything is Data Science

Beyond data science, I have a diverse range of passions, including exploring second-hand bookstores, finding inspiration in poetry and literature, and embarking on urban (and not so urban) adventures on foot.

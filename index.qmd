# Hello!

I’m Olaf, a fourth-year Data Science student at the University of Valencia.

Over the past three years, I've earned 25 distinctions with Honors in subjects such as Statistical Inference, Databases, Data Processing, and Data Visualization. While I'm proud of these achievements, my [personal projects](./projects/index.qmd) mean more to me than any grade — I'd be happy if you took a moment to check them out.

Beyond data science, I love these little objects with strange symbols that people usually call _books_. I don't know why.

Here's a brief overview of my work experience and the awards I’ve received:

### Work Experience

**Data Science Research Intern** @ IDAL, University of Valencia

March 2024 - Sept. 2024

- **Conducted research on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques** as part of an internship at IDAL, leading to the creation of an innovative app named _AI Debate_.
- **Developed _AI Debate_ from concept to completion**, which simulates debates between Spain’s Prime Minister and the opposition leader using _Large Language Models_ (LLMs) integrated with RAG methodologies.

### Awards and Recognition

- **First prize** in the II Valencia SDG Data Visualization Contest (Sep. 2022), for the project *Ruzafapp*.
- **Second prize** in the Valencia SDG Data Visualization Contest (Sep. 2023), for the project *VLC TrànsitAire*, where I collaborated with a team of five.
- **Top 1%** of University Entrance Exam (PAU) scores at the University of Valencia, out of nearly 7000 students.
